# Week 2 – Day 1: Networking Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how data moves across networks
- Learn core networking concepts relevant to cybersecurity

## OSI Model
1. Physical – Cables, signals
2. Data Link – MAC addresses, switches
3. Network – IP addresses, routing
4. Transport – TCP & UDP
5. Session – Session management
6. Presentation – Encryption, encoding
7. Application – HTTP, FTP, DNS

## TCP vs UDP
- TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented, slower
- UDP: Fast, connectionless, less reliable

## Common Ports
- 22 – SSH
- 80 – HTTP
- 443 – HTTPS
- 53 – DNS

## Commands Practiced
- ifconfig
- ping google.com
- netstat -an
- arp -a

## Security Relevance
Networking fundamentals help identify open ports, suspicious traffic, and attack vectors.
