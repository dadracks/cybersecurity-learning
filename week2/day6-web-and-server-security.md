# Week 2 – Day 6: Web & Server Security

## Focus
Understanding how web servers operate, how Linux permissions control access, and how misconfigurations impact security and availability.

---

## Topics Covered
- How HTTP works and how browsers communicate with servers
- Differences between HTTP and HTTPS
- Common HTTP status codes (200, 403, 404)
- Meaning of “connection refused” and its security implications
- Linux file and directory permissions
- Relationship between system administration and cybersecurity

---

## Hands-On Practice
- Deployed a basic web page using a Linux server environment
- Configured `public_html` permissions to allow secure web access
- Troubleshot permission-based access errors
- Identified network-level restrictions affecting web services
- Validated server accessibility using command-line tools

---

## Tools Used
- Linux Terminal
- Apache Web Server
- SSH
- curl
- systemctl
- ss

---

## Security Concepts Applied
- Principle of least privilege
- Access control via file and directory permissions
- Service availability vs security controls
- Importance of correct server configuration
- How misconfigurations can lead to security risks

---

## Key Takeaways
This lab demonstrated how security, networking, and system administration are tightly connected. Even small configuration or permission errors can prevent services from functioning or expose systems to risk.
