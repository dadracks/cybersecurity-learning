# Week 2 – Day 4: Wireshark & Packet Analysis

## What Is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect network traffic in real time.

## Packet Capture
Packets contain data transmitted over a network, including source/destination IPs and protocols.

## Common Protocols Observed
- HTTP
- DNS
- TCP
- UDP

## Filters Used
- http
- dns
- tcp
- udp

## Observations
- DNS requests resolve domain names to IP addresses
- HTTP traffic can be viewed in plaintext
- TCP packets show connection-oriented communication

## Security Relevance
Packet analysis helps identify suspicious traffic, data exfiltration, and insecure protocols.
