# Week 2 – Day 2: Ports, Firewalls, and DNS

## Ports
Ports are communication endpoints used by services.
- Open ports expose services
- Closed ports deny access

### Common Ports
- 21 – FTP
- 22 – SSH
- 25 – SMTP
- 53 – DNS
- 80 – HTTP
- 443 – HTTPS

## Firewalls
Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic.

### Types of Firewalls
- Packet-filtering
- Stateful inspection
- Application-layer firewalls

## DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.

### Security Risks
- DNS spoofing
- DNS cache poisoning
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

## Terminal Commands Practiced
- netstat -an
- lsof -i
- nslookup google.com
- dig google.com

## Security Relevance
Misconfigured ports and weak firewall rules are common attack vectors in real-world breaches.
