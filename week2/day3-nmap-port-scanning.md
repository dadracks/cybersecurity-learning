## TryHackMe Documentation (Day 3 Completion)

The TryHackMe **Nmap** room was completed using local documentation and tooling due to AttackBox unavailability.

Nmap switches and scan options were reviewed using:
- nmap -h
- man nmap

### Switches Learned
- -sS (TCP SYN scan)
- -sU (UDP scan)
- -vv (verbosity level 2)
- -oA (all output formats)
- -oN (normal output)
- -oG (grepable output)
- -A (aggressive scan)
- -T5 (timing template level 5)
- -p 80 (single port scan)
- -p 1000-1500 (port range scan)
- -p- (scan all ports)
- --script
- --script=vuln

This approach reflects real-world scenarios where tools or environments may be restricted.
